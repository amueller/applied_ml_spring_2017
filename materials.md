### Recommended reading
The following books will help you further your understanding of the material:

- Müller, Guido: Introduction to machine learning with python (IMLP) (available **for free** for Columbia Students via [http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/book/programming/machine-learning/9781449369880](Safari Books Online))
- Kuhn, Johnson: Applied predictive modeling (APM)
- Provost / Fawcett: Data Science for Business (DSfB)
- Tibshibani, Hastie, Friedman: Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL)

The course will closely follow IMLP, which also comes with Python code and uses
scikit-learn (as we will). APM provides goes into more detail than IMLP but
only contains R code. We will not use any R code in this course. DSfB focusses
on a more high-level perspective and the practical impact of data science,
while ESL contains a rigorous mathematical treatment of the machine learning
methods.
